# GDV-PeggleProject

Titel = PeggleVoid
Genre = Dark, Valetine
Beschrijving = de character/cupid(bal) bow and arrows shooting at the humans with arrows. If the arrow hits the right target they get points but if they hit a monster, which isn't allowed. 

Bal type = Character is like a bad cupid.
Targets and bumps = humans that the character hits. There are monsters/enemys you cant hit. There are some bumps that will effect the arrow and you will lose it or it bounces back.
Score: if you hit a human you get a point or if you hit a monster/enemy you lose one/multiple points.
Doel: Hitting multiple humans and not monsters because they are bad for the cupid.

Thema: Tavernish, dark cupid.

Structuur van game:
Boven aan: character throwing arrow 
Midden/everywhere: enemys, lovers(aka human)
